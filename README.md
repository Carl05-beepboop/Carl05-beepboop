**INTRODUCTION**

Hi there,


Since I don't like too much personal talking, I will just bring up here a couple of essential pieces of information so that you might understand why this profile was created.

I am a Brazilian physics student (that likes coding) who created a GitHub profile to set up my college stuff. Nothing special, nothing too focusing on the coding as a computer science student would probably do and not professional as well. Perhaps, in time, I might as well learn some other programming languages. For now, I am just learning C and LaTeX for college purposes, but I'm truly planning to study other languages (e.g., Python, Lua, MATLAB, and so on).

My main goals with programming languages are to try to solve problems (and this is connected to my graduation in general), improve my computational thoughts (which I consider
an abstract area), and also have some fun programming somehow cool ideas that comes to mind eventually. xD

As you may have noticed, I can speak English but my comments on the codes were/are written all in Portuguese (since I had to send them in Portuguese to the professor), but I may be able
to handle both English and Portuguese (and also Spanish if really needed). 


**WISH TO LEARN: LEARNING**
