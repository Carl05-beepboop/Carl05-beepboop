**Hi there**,


Since I don't like too much talking, I will just say here that I am a brazilian physics student (that likes coding) which created a github profile to organize my college stuff.
Nothing special, nothing too focusing on the coding as a computer science student would probably do, not too professional as well. Perhaps,
in time, I might as well learn some other programming languages. For now, I am just learning C and LaTeX for college purposes, but I'm truly planning to study other languages
(e.g., Python, Lua, MATLAB and so on).

My main goals with the programming languages is to try to solve problems (and this is connected to my graduation in general), improve my computational thoughts (which I consider
an abstract area) and also to have some fun programming some cool ideas that comes to mind. xD

As you may have noticed, I can speak english but my comments on the codes were/are written all in portuguese (since I had to send in portuguese to the professor), but I may be able
to handle both english and portuguese (and also spanish if needed).
